Baron de'Coubertin envisaged the Running event as the Soldier's final dash through the enemy lines to deliver his message.
</i>
</p>

<p>
Running has always been modern pentathlon's final event.
</p>

<p>
At Olympic level a Hungarian or chase start operates where competitors start in points order, thus providing an equal finish.
</p>


<p>
<b>Warm up and cool down:</b><br></br><br></br>
-	jog before stretching to warm muscles before running
-	after the run/any other time stretch to aid recovery and increase flexibility/the probability of injury  
</p>

<p>	
<b>Running:</b><br></br><br></br>
-	to improve your competition time you must train on distances much shorter than 3km (Wed night on track - on at 6pm every week) and longer endurance runs (i.e. 10 miles+ on Sunday, 10am Rad Cam)
-	when on the track you really must push yourself so you really feel your muscles burning due to the intensity
-	make sure you keep moving in a slow jog between intervals
-	the jog should pretty much at walking pace, but you should be on the balls of your feet, quick light steps, loose top half which is free to recover
-	by the end of the jog you should be ready-ish to do it all again, so the slower paced jog the better
-	then when you hit that line to start the sprint you run like the wind (duh)
-	it is important to work out what your realistic target lap time is in a 3km race
-	then you can use this in the sets to come and you'll go faster and faster and faster, guaranteed
</p>

<p>
<b>Recovery:</b><br></br><br></br>
-	after exercising hard like tonight you have an opportunity to get faster/stronger by pilling on the carbohydrates WITHIN 2 HOURS OF FINISHING THE SET
-	in this window, carbohydrates (good!) are rapidly absorbed and will help your muscles recover asap
-	it is best to have a massive balanced carbo meal asap after training, but if not available any source of carbohydrate is good (fast or slow releasing e.g. mars bar to wholemeal bread)
-	bananas, Soreen malt loaf, orange squash, jaffa cakes etc are good sources... PS you will not get fat - simply impossible if you run hard. Period.
</p>

<p>
<b>Kit:</b><br></br><br></br>
-	good comfy trainers that you can run for miles in
-	track spikes
-	leggings
-	watch with lap/split function
-	recovery drink (High5)
</p>

<p>
<b>Fun:</b><br></br><br></br>
-	one of the good things about running is you barely need any kit
-	you can run any time, anywhere... don't forget that!
