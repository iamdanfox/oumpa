<h1>
The Benefits of Joining OUMPA
</h1>


<p>
Everybody gets something different out of modern pentathlon. This isn't a bland statement of the obvious, it's an essential quality of this very diverse sport. The benefits of actually joining a modern pentathlon club like OUMPA are therefore even wider-ranging and individual. It's probably best to list the most common that we've come across:
</p>

<p>
The chance to learn completely new sports- perfect for great sportsmen looking for a challenge, even better for those with no real sporting experience but plenty of enthusiasm
</p>

<p>
The chance to earn an Oxford Blue- a universally recognised sporting accolade
</p>

<p>
The informal, easy-going atmosphere of training sessions
</p>

<p>
Competitions- Novice Varsity, Cuppers, National Tet, Old Blues, BUSA, Varsity-
Your performance improves over the year with your scores, as does your understanding of the sport and its structures
</p>

<p>
Other benefits include- the opportunity to continue riding/fencing/swimming etc from where you might have left off
</p>

<p>
The commitment of older members to assist younger in all aspects of skills training
</p>

<p>
Always having to explain what the sports are (not cycling) and the look on people's faces
</p>

<p>
Getting to know a sport where Great Britain have historically been and continue to be successful at Olympic and international level.
