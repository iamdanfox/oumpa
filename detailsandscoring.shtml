<h1>
Five Events - 5000 Points
</h1>

<p>
The Pentathlon is made up of five events. In the Modern form these events are <b>Shooting, Fencing, Swimming, Riding</b> and <b>Running</b>. Points are scored in each event and the total of these ponits determines the winner. The target for each event is 1000 points and each event has differnt critera for getting those 1000 points. Below is a short description of each event and the calculation for scoring points.
</p>

<h2>
Shooting
</h2>

<p>
Pentathletes are required to fire 20 shots at a target placed 10 metres away using a 4.5 millimetre air pistol. Each shot must be fired with one hand, from the same position and with a time limit of 40 seconds per shot.
</p>

<p>
Targets consist of concentric rings with a centre circle. Each ring has a point value ranging from 1 point for the outer ring to 10 points for the centre circle - if a shot borders on two rings then the higher point value is counted. Targets are changed after each shot.
</p>

<p>
Target points are translated into competition points, with 172 target points (out of a maximum of 200) equating to 1,000 competition points; each target point above or below 172 increases or decreases the competition points by 12. For example - 174 target points would equate to 1,024 competition points and 170 target points would equate to 976 competition points.
</p>

<h2>
Fencing
</h2>

alt="Fencing"
align="left"
hspace="8"
vspace="8"
/>

<p>
Each pentathlete is required to fence once with every other competitor using epee swords. The target area is the whole body and hits are registered via an electronic tip at the end of the sword. The winner of each bout is the first to score a hit. If neither competitor has scored a hit after one minute, then both lose.
</p>

<p>
Victories are translated into competition points, with 1,000 competition points being awarded to pentathletes who win 70% of their bouts; each victory above or below this limit increases or decreases the competition points by 28.
</p>

<p>
Penalties, in the form of competition points, are imposed for dangerous play, crossing boundary lines and several other offences, for example - a fencer who turns his or her back on an opponent receives a 10 point penalty.
</p>

<h2>
Swimming
</h2>

<img src="assets/pageimages/swimming.jpg"
alt="Swimming"
align="right"
hspace="8"
vspace="8"
/>

<p>
Pentathletes are required to swim a 200 metre freestyle race against the clock. Heats are seeded based on previous best times.
</p>

<p>
Times are translated into competition points, with 2 minutes 30 seconds (men's event) and 2 minutes 40 seconds (women's event) equating to 1,000 competition points; each second above or below these times increases or decreases the competition points by 12. For example - if a woman finished in 2 minutes 35 seconds, this would equate to 1,060 competition points.
</p>

<p>
Any pentathlete who commits two false starts or fails to touch the end of the pool when turning faces a 40 point penalty.
</p>


<br clear="right" />
<h2>
Riding
</h2>

<img src="assets/pageimages/riding.jpg"
alt="Riding"
align="left"
hspace="8"
vspace="8"
/>

<p>
Pentathletes are required to ride an unfamiliar horse over a 350-450 metre course which features 12 show jumping obstacles including a double and a treble.
</p>

<p>
Horses are drawn at random and each pentathlete has 20 minutes to familiarise themselves with the horse.
</p>

<p>
Each pentathlete begins riding with 1,100 competition points and loses points for each penalty incurred.
</p>

<p>
Penalties include 3 points per second over the standard time for the course, 30 points for knocking any part of an obstacle to the ground, 40 points for disobedience or refusal to jump and 60 points for falling.
</p>

<br clear="left" />

<h2>
Running
</h2>

<img src="assets/pageimages/running.jpg"
alt="Running"
align="right"
hspace="8"
vspace="8"
/>

<p>
Pentathletes are required to run a 3,000 metre cross country course.
</p>

<p>
Times are translated into competition points, with 10 minutes (mens event) and 11 minutes 20 seconds (womens event) equating to 1,000 competition points; each half-second above or below these times increases or decreases the competition points by 2. For example - if a man finished in 9 minutes 50 seconds, this would equate to 1,040 competition points.
</p>

<p>
The points awarded for the other four disciplines are used to determine the starting order and starting times are calculated such that the first three runners to cross the line become the three medalists for the whole competition.
