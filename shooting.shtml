For each of the events, there is a background in Baron de Coubertin's imaginary story of a young army officer required to carry a message through enemy lines- a daring and tough assignment pushing him to his physical limits and testing his military skills. The events have changed their order to the present day, but the essential idea remains the same. In the second event of de Coubertin's story, the young officer was supposed to take down an enemy with a single shot. So modern pentathlon sought to test the individual's ability to shoot extremely accurately under pressure.

Today's Shooting Event tests your calm and coordination. You fire twenty shots at a concentric-ringed target, with a black central bull. Each shot is a complete event, with 10 seconds to load and 40 seconds to fire. A target point either way is worth 12 points or 3 seconds in the run.

As a member of the club you'll have access to the club's top of the range .144 Walther pistols. They are light and easy to operate. We'll teach you the basics, but when you find all your shots on target you'll probably want to think about some of the principles of marksmanship. These can be exhaustive but in overview can include: stance, breathing, point of aim, grip, trigger control, follow-through. Before going to a competition it's also essential to learn how to adjust your sights (as some have learnt from bitter experience)
