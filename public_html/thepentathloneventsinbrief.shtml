<h2>What is OUMPA?</h2>


<p><b>OUMPA</b> stands for Oxford University Modern Pentathlon Association. The five events of modern pentathlon are <b>Shooting</b>, <b>Fencing</b>, <b>Riding</b>, <b>Swimming</b> and <b>Running</b>. The sports are not done continuosly as in Triathlon but one by one, over the course of one or two days. Pentathlon combines the speed and stamina aspects of the run and swim with the skills required in fencing, shooting and riding. In this way it tests the athlete in many different and exciting ways. It is this great variety in the sport which makes it so addictive.</p>

<p>If you are interested in trying some or any of the events feel free to contact a member of the <a href="officers.shtml">
Committee</a> or turn up to one of our <a href="timetable.shtml">
training sessions</a>. The sport is for people of all abilities so why not try it. For those interested there are usually several <a href="calendar.shtml">
competitions</a> each term both at and outside Oxford. Modern Pentathlon is a full blue sport, we have our Varsity Match at the end of Hilary term.</p>

<p>There is also a strong social side to pentathlon and particularly OUMPA, so if you want to be part of what is probably the most friendly club in Oxford then come along.</p>
