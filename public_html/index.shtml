<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
"In Modern Pentathlon individuals compete over five disciplines-
Shooting, Fencing, Swimming, Riding, & Running.
The sport is a true test of all-round ability and physical stamina.
</p>

<p>
OUMPA is Oxford University's modern pentathlon club. We train in Oxford's
first-class facilities located at Iffley Road and  compete in a number of
internal matches and external competitions up to National level. Past members
have gone on to the GBR team and even to Olympic success.
</p>

<p>
At Varsity level, the basis of the OUMPA's success in recent years, has been the 
wide variety of its members. There is an equal balance of men and women.
Moreover, we depend upon a mixture of outstanding, experienced sportsmen and
total novices in some or all of the sports to fill our Blues teams. This has
ensured an open and co-operative atmosphere in all that we do. In 2005 this 
success was recognised in our award as Club of the Year.
</p>

<p>
We are also lucky to have excellent support from the Sports Fed
and above all a generous Old Blues network
OUMPA can therefore provide kit, training facilities and coaching for
anyone who joins.
</p>

<p>
All that you require to take part are enthusiasm and the will to take on 
Cambridge in this exciting Blues sport."
