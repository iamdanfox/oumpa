Fencing Training Advice

One-hit Epee against all other competitors

</p>

<p>

Target Score: 70% hits = 1000pts
<br></br>
1 hit = &plusmn; 24 - 40pts (depending on numbers)
</p>

<p><i>
Having shot his first enemy, de Coubertin's officer then draws his sword to fence another to the death.
</i></p>

<p>
Fencing is of course another modern day survivor.  In Modern Pentathlon you fence each of your opponents once (or twice depending on numbers) attempting to score a single hit to win each bout.
</p>

<p>
It is above all a supreme test of skill, but also of aggression and the ability to  read one's opponent. Fencing for Oxford is something you're unlikely to achieve without some years' experience of fencing, but Modern Pentathlon offers that opportunity in one of the most exciting moments of the Varsity.
</p>

<p>
Fencing requires the following kit (all supplied and available to hire from OUMPA):
</p>

<p>
Mask, Jacket, Plastron, Glove, Breeches, Long Socks &amp; Trainers and
Body Wire &amp; Epee.
</p>

<p>
A single fencing hit (at epee) can be scored anywhere on your opponent's body. The epee is wired into a buzzer which records who scored the first hit, thus reflecting who has won the point. 
</p>
