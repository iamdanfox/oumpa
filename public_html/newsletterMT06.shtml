<h1>
Michaelmas Term 2006 Newsletter
</h1>

<p>
The past term has seen a number of notable successes for the club, a few crises briskly averted and a great deal of basic training.
</p>

<p>
The term began with an unprecedented boom in the maillist up to 300 names.  The tactical shift of placing OUMPA amongst the dancing societies at Freshers Fair allowed us to learn from Dancesport's ruthless methods (1000+ maillist) - and pick up not a few of Oxford's unsusupecting lighter-footed individuals.
</p>

<p>
At the Freshers sessions we were often swamped by newcomers, and the total of 15 Oxford competitors at Novice Varsity was probably optimal, with Cambridge offering similar numbers. New recruits continue to stream through as the year goes on and a target total mmebership of 30 by Varsity in March has been set- doubling last year's numbers.
</p>

<p>
Competitions were few this term- the standard pairing of Novice Varsity and Cuppers was supplemented by a trip to the Yorkshire Pentathlon in October.
Competition at Yorkshire was of an extremely high standard- and OUMPA fitness was just resurfacing after three months off. In the Men's event, James Corbet Burcher and Mostyn Brown placed 4th and 6th respectively (the latter would undoubtedly have placed 2nd had he not had an uncharacteristic elmination in the ride). Kate Cokayne Naylor placed. In the Women's Kate Cokayne-Naylor took 8th place.
</p>

<p>
Novice Varsity was an extremely close event- marred slightly by low turnout by Cambridge in the ride and some slightly haphazard last-minute organisation- in the end Cambridge squeezed through overall with top scores and top three rides counting by a margin of a few hundred points. There were some excellent rides (Kathryn Hadley, Sally Brunton, Martin Lennon), fences (Kaitlin  Vadla, Audria Crain, Adam Maitland) shoots (Sally Brunton) and runs (Kathryn Hadley, Adam Maitland).
</p>

<p>
Cuppers was won by a Worcester side for a second year running.
</p>

<p>
On the social side, events were patchy- Novice Varsity was as ever boozy, and ended comically outside Mostyn's house. Curries and Christmas Dinner remained popular.On the kit side, we renewed our stock of individual fencing kit and encouraged members to time their physicals more accurately
</p>

<p>
All eyes are now on the competitions ahead. The squad is strong with some excellent all-rounders and many more inidividuals training hard to gain invaluable experience. With a set of assessments coming up in January before National Tet, BUSA and finally Varsity- each member is expected to stay off the pud for the Christmas season and keep fit for the new year.
