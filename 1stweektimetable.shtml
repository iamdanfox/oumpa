<h2>
Notes:
</h2>

<p>
1) You may come to as many or as few of the introductory sessions as you can make. Whether you are a complete novice, or are an experienced competitor in any of the individual sports, the introductory sessions will be tailored to suit your level of experience. They are designed not only as an introduction to the sport but also as a chance for you to meet the club.
</p>

<p>
2) Equipment for the shooting and fencing will be provided if you do not have your own.
</p>

<p>
3) All sessions are free apart from the horse riding
</p>

<p>
4) Essential 6th (drinking) and 7th (pulling) event practice will take place at the Freshers Drinks. If you miss all other training introductions then just make sure you can make it to this one!
