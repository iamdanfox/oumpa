<h1>
Novice Varsity 2006 - Friday 27th Oct. (3rd week)
</h1>

<p>
The Novice Varsity is a scaled down Varsity match (match between Oxford and Cambridge). It is open to those that have joined the Pentathlon this year.
</p>

<p>
Novice varsity is great fun. First real pentathlon with no pressure  at all. The idea is to get a taster and find out if you like going to competitions that require 7 types of footwear (!). It would be great to have a good showing of novices this year, as OUMPA are hosting it in Oxford this year and really it requires little effort, as everything happens in or around Ifley, except riding, which we will bus you to.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry if you can't ride, come and do the other four events. If you can't fence or shoot, come down this week or next and learn - we'll have you ready for the novices in a few sessions.  The social afterwards will be awesome, and you can meet your opposite numbers in Cambrdige.
</p>

<p>
Old OUMP-ites, I expect to see a good showing; to support our novices, cheer Oxford on, help direct people around town, and show your skills at 6th eventing!
</p>

<h2>
